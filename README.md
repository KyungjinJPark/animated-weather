# Welcome to my domain

**In this project,** I created an app that displays the weather in your area.

I dipped my feet in the world of animations in React using `react-spring` as the animation library, and I also added a dark/light mode feature that changes depending on time period of the displayed weather. I added some ***cute*** animations of a snowman or sun that autoplays in the main display using Airbnb's `lottie`.

Lil cool feature of the app: the week display at the bottom is a drag scroll list (courtesy of `react-indiana-drag-scroll`), so you can click and drag to view the weather for different time periods. Each time period is also an animated button, so give 'em a click and the main display will change.

I think it would be cool to do some more complex, interactive, and creative animations using something like `animejs` down the road.

> sadly, it actually has nothing to do with anime ... in case you were wondering.

There is a bit of working with REST APIs and using geolocation.


### !! The production build has a bug !!
There is some error that I believe has to do with `react-spring`. Therefore, production builds (including the `gh-pages` page), **but** if you *really* want to see the app, you're going to have to view the `npm start` test version... Sorry.

Thanks Jonah and Jonah's dad for introducing me to the weather.gov api.

And thanks to me for my master After Effects skills and my designers eye *wink.
